	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h3><img src="Images/profile.jpg" alt="Me"/></h3>
	<h2>Sarah V. Braddock</h2>
	<h3>Aspiring writer pursuing a Journalism degree from the University of Miami.</h3>
	<p>The human experience is something that we all share. Music, physical and emotional wellness and self-exploration all serve as avenues of deepening our personal and shared adventures.</p>
	<p>The way we eat and move our bodies, media we consume and personal narratives on replay in our minds shape our lives. All of these elements are easily manipulated for the better, if you want them to be. We create our realities every single day through surrounding ourselves with content that mirrors the kind of person we want to be.</p>
	<p>Exploring this further within myself and others through writing and design is something I aim to transform into a lifelong career.</p>
	<p>I hope you reap something from my work, whether now or in the future, that connects you to yourself and others.</p>
