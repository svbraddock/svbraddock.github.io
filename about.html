	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h3><img src="Images/profile.jpg" alt="Me"/></h3>
	<h2>Sarah V. Braddock</h2>
	<h3>Aspiring writer pursuing a Journalism degree from the University of Miami.</h3>
	<p>The human experience is something that we all share.</p>
	<p> Music, physical and emotional wellness and self-exploration all serve as avenues of deeping our personal and shared adventures.</p>
	<p>Exploring this deeper within myself and others through writing and design is something I hope to transform into a lifelong career.</p>
	<p>I hope you reap something from my work, whether now or in the future, that helps you become further cemented in your humanity and connects you to yourself and others.</p>
