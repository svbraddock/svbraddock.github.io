	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h3><img src="Images/profile.jpg" alt="Me"/></h3>
	<h2>Sarah V. Braddock</h2>
	<h3>Aspiring music journalist pursuing a Journalism degree from the University of Miami.</h3>
<p>Discovering music and shedding light on deserving artists through articles or sharing playlists with friends and family has always been one of my favorite pastimes.</p>

<p>Music decorates time. It allows the fixation on moments and emotions dotting the entire spectrum of good and bad. Listening to all kinds of artists and bands makes me feel less alone in this world, connecting me with both the musicians themselves as well as those around me.</p>

<p>Saying that, I love (mostly) all music. Listening to it, seeing it live, talking about it, writing about it, discovering it and most importantly having lots and lots of opinions about it.</p>

<p>I hope to share playlists to accompany your highest highs and lowest lows as well as shed light on deserving artists new and old.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, music is a language we can all understand. Explore it a little deeper and you'll be amazed at what you find.

	<h2>AND A TOUCH OF PREACHY VEGANISM FOR YA</h2>

<p>As any vegan will tell you, going entirely plant-based was the best decision I've ever made.</p>

<p>About a year ago, I was confronted with the simple idea of "does the pleasure you get from animal products justify the suffering and/or death, of another being?" The answer there for me was clearly no.</p>

<p>I had always been an animal lover growing up and began questioning the hypocrisy of supposedly loving animals while simultaneously eating them. It didn't, and never will, add up.</p>

<p>The next day I made a vow, giving up all animal products. From there I learned about the devastating environmental impacts of animal agriculture as well and the toll it has taken on the health of much of the Western world.</p>

<p>I hope you reap something from this website and gain inspiration to start living plant-based. I promise you it will impact your life just as much as it's impacted mine.</p>
