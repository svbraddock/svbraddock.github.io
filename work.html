	<h2>"You and Your Friends" - Peach Pit Album Review</h2>
<p>Self-described as “chewed bubblegum pop,” Peach Pit’s new album perfectly pairs with their freshman release, “Being So Normal.” The album opens with self-pitying anthem “Feelin’ Low (F*ckboy Blues).” This was the first single the band released from this album, definitely making fans all over wanting more. It served the same function on the album, making you want to keep listening and see where these ballads of melancholy and adolescent strife lead to.</p> 

<p>Canadian indie pop band, Peach Pit, released its second album, “You and Your Friends,” April 3, following the release of three singles from the album, “Feelin’ Low (F*ckboy Blues),” “Shampoo Bottles,” and “Black Licorice.” </p>

<p>The band formed in 2016, consisting of Neil Smith on vocals and rhythm guitar, Christopher Vankerkooy on lead guitar, Peter Wilson on bass and vocal harmonies, and Mikey Pascuzzi on Drums. They have performed at Bonnaroo, Shaky Knees Music Festival, CBC Music Festival, and Capitol Hill Block Party. Today it is signed with Columbia Records.</p>

	<h2>Modern Listeners Shifting Towards Playlists Over Albums, Study Says</h2>
<p>While streaming music makes listening easier than ever before, a new study shows that "over half of us listen to fewer albums than 5-10 years ago.</p> 
<p>After streaming platform Deezer surveyed 8,000 people, the music service discovered that many modern listeners prefer playlists to albums: 40% to be exact. So why exactly are albums, as the survey indicated, ‘not like they used to be’? One explanation could be that with the influx of streaming services and variety of quality listening experiences we have, consumers have become more selective in what they listen to.</p>
